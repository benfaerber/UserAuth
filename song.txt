No one can fix a heart.
Listen to me now, leave me alone now.
And don't call me again.
I don't have time not yesterday or today, not tomorrow and not anytime!
Just finally understand this!
It is no longer what is was.
You gotta understand it won't ever happen.
I won't get it back!
Just keep moving!
The offer is huge!
Grip onto new happiness!
I don't want to be with you anymore!
No one can fix a heart.
It is one, then its two pieces then its all over.
Noone knows how it goes, most of the time it's too late!
There is no cure, just tears running
Everything will stay empty and also the doctor doesn't help anymore.
